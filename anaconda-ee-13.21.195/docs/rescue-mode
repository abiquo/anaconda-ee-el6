Rescue mode
-----------

1/4/1999 Michael Fulbright

Rescue mode is implemented via a bootable CDROM currently. The user
specifies 'linux rescue' at the syslinux prompt when the CDROM boots.
Then the kernel and an initial ramdisk is loaded. The installer is
run and the user is dropped into bash.

The upd-instroot script in the anaconda/ source toplevel directory
is responsible for creating the instimage which is used as the
root for the rescue environment. It is located in /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/instimage
when the CDROM is mounted under /mnt/cdrom.
