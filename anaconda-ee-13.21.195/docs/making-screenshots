How to make screenshots:


This will only currently work for graphical installs.

During a graphical installation, you can now press SHIFT-Print Screen
and a screenshot of the current installation screen will be taken.

These are stored in the following directory:

   /root/anaconda-screenshots/

The screenshots can be accessed once the newly-installed system is rebooted.
