gettext, i18n, and the po/ subdirectory

---------------------------------------

I have attempted to clean up our po/ subdirectory and bring it in to
conformance with GNU gettext tools as well as hook it in to GNU autoconf and
GNU automake.  The gettext software has templates set up for this already,
so I'm just using those.

From time to time, we may have to update our gettext template files and or
expand or reduce the information in the files.  How do you know what files
do what?  Here's an explanation:

m4/gettext.m4
m4/iconv.m4
m4/lib-ld.m4
m4/lib-link.m4
m4/lib-prefix.m4
m4/nls.m4
m4/po.m4
m4/progtest.m4
po/Makefile.in.in
po/Rules-quot
po/boldquot.sed
po/en@boldquot.header
po/en@quot.header
po/insert-header.sin
po/quot.sed
po/remove-potcdate.sin

    These files are copied in when 'gettextize' is run on the source
    project.  When we need to update to a newer minimum version of
    gettext, these files will be replaced.  In general, we should never
    need to touch these files.

po/Makevars

    Should be updated when we update gettext files with a new gettextize
    run.  A file called po/Makevars.template will appear and we can move
    over our values to the new file and commit it.  We do not need to
    change this file on a regular basis.

po/POTFILES.in

    This file contains a listing of all source files in the project that
    have translatable strings.

po/LINGUAS

    Space-delimited list of languages available.  If a new language is
    added, it should be added to this file.

po/*.po

    Actual translated strings, as maintained by the translation team(s).
